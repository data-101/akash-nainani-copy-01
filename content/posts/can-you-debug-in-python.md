# Introduction

For a long time, I have been using print statement to debug my programs in python. As the size of programs that I wrote increased it started getting messy with the print statements and it became ever so difficult to pinpoint what is going wrong. So, I started my search on possible alternatives and was successful. In this article, I talk about pdb and PySnooper(This is pretty Interesting!).



So, Check out my post at Medium. 

A Sneek peek, if you code in python you will appreciate the library that i mention.
