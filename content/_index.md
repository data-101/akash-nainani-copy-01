      I'm a Software Engineer by profession. But I don't like to limit myself by
      a designation, I like to call myself a creator or a maker. I love to solve
      real world problem and if we end up having a discussion it would most
      likely be some technology or some sort of problem.  Currently I'm all
      about Deep learning and developing full stack solutions to all sorts of
      problems. You will find a projects section on the left. "Definitely!"
      check that out, you will find live working demo of things I've built.
      Also, I'm giving a shot to blogging so do check out articles too. You can
      find them below.
